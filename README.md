## :surfer: Introduction
The purpose of this repo is to help you build a cool bot with Rasa.

It's the alpha version of the bot that supports two user goals:
- Subscribing to the newsletter
- Placing a request for a call with the sales team

You can find planned enhancement for the demo in the [Project Board](https://github.com/RasaHQ/killer-demo/projects/1)
