        spaCy has excellent pre-trained named-entity recognisers for this. Check out this interactive demo https://demos.explosion.ai/displacy-ent/ .
        Hence, I would suggest using the ner_crf component in your pipeline.
  utter_duckling:
    - text: >
        Mhm, for this use case I would suggest the Facebook library Duckling 🐥
        To do so, use the ner_duckling_http component in your pipeline and spin up a duckling server as it is described in their documentation: https://duckling.wit.ai/
  utter_crf:
    - text: >
        I currently don't know a library which provides pretrained recognisers for that. Therefore, you best train the extraction by yourself using the ner_crf component.
        So use that and annote your nlu data like it is described here: https://rasa.com/docs/nlu/dataformat/ .
  utter_nlu_tools:
    - text: >
        A great tool to get more NLU data is Chatito (https://rodrigopivi.github.io/Chatito/).
        If you find annotating your data cumbersome our NLU trainer might be help you to ease things: https://rasahq.github.io/rasa-nlu-trainer/
