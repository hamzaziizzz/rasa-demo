* faq/is_programming_required
  - Rasa Open Source is written in Python, but programming is not required to develop an assistant. To learn how to create an assistant, check out the [Rasa Masterclass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlAQWbhwqLA). There is one place where programming skills come in handy, and that is when implementing [custom actions](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/core/actions/#custom-actions). You can create an action server in Node.js, .NET, Java, or any other language and define your actions there. For custom actions written in Python, we provide a small [Python SDK](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/api/rasa-sdk/#rasa-sdk) to make development even easier.
